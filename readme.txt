A colorful, dynamic shooter in which you control a small ship and avoid incoming cubes by maneuvering past them, shooting them, exploding them, or even teleporting past them. Earn money by acquiring achievements and collecting coins, and buy upgrades to change the appearance and functionality of your ship. Level up, and the game gets more exciting, more colorful, and more difficult. Just remember: dodge, duck, dip, dive, and dodge.
